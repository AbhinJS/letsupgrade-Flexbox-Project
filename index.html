            <h2>I saw a jewel-blue stream in the forest.</h2>
            <p>I spied a gem-blue stream in the forest. It was seeping and dribbling as it swerved through the trees. It jumped for joy over the timeworn rocks. I heard once that rivers are the arteries of the forest. </p>

            <h2> THE CLEAR LAKE</h2>
            <p>The lake was as silver as diamond flame and the atmosphere was convent quiet. Even the depths were vodka clear. It was soothing and yogi still. Freckled trout were leaping for flies and thunking on its surface.

            <h2> A wall of snow came crashing down</h2>
            <p>The mountains were vampire-white. A wave of white snow went rumbling down the sides. They were all crumpled at the base.
